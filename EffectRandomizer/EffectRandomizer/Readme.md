Changes subtle aspects of most game items, so they no
longer behave completely as expected.

# Alterations:

  - Projectiles may borrow each other's behaviors.  They
can make unexpected noises, follow odd paths, or even
home.
  - Firing modes can lase, split, ricochet, or change
speeds.
  - Parts have different effects on shield behavior.
A common Absorb shield with lucky parts may beat a Sham.
  - The same applies to classmods.  With good parts,
a high-level mod could potentially boost a skill more
than +6.
  - Lastly, relics now boost random attributes.  Really
want an artifact that improves corrosion damage and 
movement speed?  It might be out there...
*Note: relics are not supported on TPS.  Oz kits have
enough quirks already.*

# Usage:

From the main menu, under Mods, enable 'Effect
Randomizer' and escape back to the main menu.  Bring
up Options->Mods->Effect Randomizer to enable the
effects you want to change, then load your character
and start the session as usual.  Changes to settings
in the in-game menu will have no effect until after
a return to the main menu.
