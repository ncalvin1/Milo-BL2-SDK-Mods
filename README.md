# Milo's BL2/TPS/AoDK Mods

This repository contains a handful of mods to Borderlands 2 and its sister
games, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel! and Tiny Tina's Attack on Dragon Keep.
All mods require the [PythonSDK](https://bl-sdk.github.io/) to be installed
first.

 - **PlayerRandomizer** randomizes a player's skills and class mods.  Ever
     wanted to gunzerk with Gaige?  Now you can!  (Thanks to Abahbob's terrific
     [Cross Class Skill Randomizer](https://bl-sdk.github.io/mods/CrossClassSkillRandomizer/) for the idea.)

 - **EffectRandomizer** shuffles subtle aspects of game items around to make it
     less predictable.  Relics, shields, class mods, and guns all have different
     characteristics than the ones you've carefully memorized and built your
     strategy around.  Your Sham might not go past 50% absorb, while your
     relic provides useful regeneration and your common white Tediore pistol
     acts like a laser.  Every seed's different!

 - **MyFavoriteMod** keeps you from accidentally selling or dropping starred
     items.

 - **StorageManager** collects most of the functionality of the various Bank
     and Backpack extenders into one convenient mod that works on all three
     games.

 - **LilithPatch** modifies the action skill of 55tumbl's excellent
     [Lilith mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands2/mods/97) to work more
     like BL1 Lilith's Phasewalk.

 - **ChangeUtil** is a small library that simplifies making changes to Unreal
     Engine objects and reverting them later.
